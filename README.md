# Waste-Management-system
The objective of this project is to develop WMS (Waste Management System) as the system that will facilitate   citizens to daily alert/notify the company about the places where there are wastes and the employees get sent to those places because it is more complicated and difficult to quickly know such places and get there at right time.
